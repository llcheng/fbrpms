          | The Facebook Rotational Product Manager program trains people excited about technology to become great Product Managers. Facebook RPMs lead three product rotations over twelve months, while receiving guidance from mentors.  At the end of the program, RPMs are equipped to lead cross-functional teams that build high-impact, meaningful products.

      p
        h2 Impact
        | RPMs work on high priority products that impact the lives of the over 1.2 billion people who use Facebook. During each rotation, RPMs have full ownership of a project. They create a product vision, set roadmaps, prioritize goals, and analyze data to measure success.  RPMs collaborate with engineers, designers, and data analysts to build world-class social tools.
        br
        br
        h2 Growth  
        | Learning and development is key to the program. On each project rotation, RPMs work closely with veteran PM mentors to develop the skills needed to become a successful Product Manager and leader at Facebook. RPMs also learn from each other — acting as sounding boards to pitch and test out new ideas.
        br
        br
        h2 Community  
        | RPMs form a tight, cohesive community within Facebook. They come from a variety of backgrounds and industries, which creates unique opportunities for learning and collaboration. In addition to a strong professional community, RPMs also become great friends. They hang out, grab lunch, and some RPMs even live together.

        | As RPMs, we build products that impact the lives of over 1.2 billion people. We're all passionate about connecting the world around us and improving the way people communicate.  We come from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences- here are just a few RPMs who have done some pretty amazing things:

        i Jokes aside, I come from a more traditional computer science background. I grew up and studied in Canada but decided to make the move out to Silicon Valley after a few great internship experiences. As a PM, I've learned how to feel when a team is operating well and working towards a vision that everyone is bought into."

About 80% of the world's population lives within range of a 2G or 3G connection, and yet well over 4B people remain unconnected to the internet. I've gotten to partner with carriers to find economically sustainable ways to make mobile data more affordable and accessible for the world."

      ul
        li.FAQuestion Q: What are some of the projects RPMs have worked on?
        li(style="color: gray;") We've worked on a wide variety of products! Here is a short list of a few examples: 
        ul.default(style="color: gray;")
          li(style="margin-left: 20px;") Driving growth and engagement in the Pages Manager mobile app
          li(style="margin-left: 20px;") Redesigning Events on mobile and web
          li(style="margin-left: 20px;") Improving the photos experience on mobile web to increase photo uploads
          li(style="margin-left: 20px;") Launching new ad formats optimized for low end mobile devices
          li(style="margin-left: 20px;") Optimizing notifications
          li(style="margin-left: 20px;") VOIP in messenger
          li(style="margin-left: 20px;") Launching and analyzing variations of the website News Feed redesign 
          li(style="margin-left: 20px;") Driving Instagram growth and adoption
        li.FAQuestion Q: How long is the RPM program?
        li(style="color: gray;") It is a one year program, during which you will take on 3 different rotations of approximately 4 months each.
        br
        li.FAQuestion Q: What kinds of things to RPMs do together?
        li(style="color: gray;") RPMs regularly hang out around the Bay Area, they organize guest-speakers to talk at Facebook, and travel abroad together to research new technology trends around the world.
        br
        li.FAQuestion Q: How is Product at Facebook different from Product at other companies? 
        li(style="color: gray;") We strive to make the Rotational PM experience as unique and individually tailored for each participant as possible. A major part of what we’re hoping the RPMs make out of their experience is impact. In just 12-18 months our 3 rotation program provides a ton of experience, variety and collaboration, in a relatively short amount of time. Facebook moves fast, and this program is no exception. Because your input is important when evaluating proper rotational project matching, you’ll work closely with your manager to give input and provide preferences on what you are interested in working on. We want PMs working on products they are passionate about. 
        br
        li.FAQuestion Q: What does a "day in the life" of a Facebook PM look like? What will people expect from you?  
        li(style="color: gray;") A typical day for me might consist of grabbing some breakfast while catching up on emails, checking in on metrics, and making sure I’ve got everything I need prepped for any meetings I might have. To kick the week off, we have Instagram team product planning meetings, where we report out on our metrics, identify our three key goals for the week, highlight any blockers, and discuss shared resources. A number of questions usually arise from these meetings, so I’ll spend the half hour afterward following up with people individually. 
        br 
        li(style="color: gray;") The next part of my day consists of lots of walking 1:1’s. Facebook’s campus is almost like an enclosed town square, and I tend to try to have meetings walking up and down the length of the campus to get some exercise in (Facebookers are quite competitive FitBit-ers!). I’ll have meetings with the tech leads, designer, and analysts on the team to catch up and plan out our work for the week. 
        br
        li(style="color: gray;") Then I may have to run to a design review, where the team meets with Kevin and Mike to go over our plans for a new feature, get their feedback and requested changes, and figure out next steps. After this, there’s usually another flurry of individual follow-ups either in person or over email. In between I may try to squeeze in a visit to Facebook’s sweet stop to grab a cup of ice cream. :) 
        br
        li(style="color: gray;") By 6:30 or so I’ll grab dinner with friends on-campus, head to my desk to shoot off a few more emails, and catch the shuttle back to the city with friends.The RPMs have a shared thread we ping around dinner time, so there are always people to have dinner with! 
        br
        li.FAQuestion Q: What happens after the program? What's the transition from RPM to PM like? 
        li(style="color: gray;") The intent of our program is to provide resources to help you develop into a well-rounded, versatile and innovative product thinker. We invest a great deal into each one of our RPMs with the intent for them to go on and continue making tremendous impact on Facebook's product. Once you have successfully completed the RPM program you will begin researching and planning which product team you’d like to move on to, as your first outside of the program.

         h2 Passion
         | RPMs are people who are passionate about developing well-crafted products that add value to people's lives and bring delight to their everyday experiences.

         br
        
         h2 Action  
         | RPMs have strong analytical skills along with the ability to break large, messy problems into discrete pieces. Once the problem has been broken down, they need to prioritize the pieces and deliver on them.
         br
         br
        
         h2 Leadership  
         | RPMs inspire and motivate their team to hit goals and ship impactful products. A Product Manager is like the conductor of an orchestra. While they do not design or build, RPMs carry the vision of a product and communicate that vision across cross-functional teams. They shouldn't be afraid to take risks and move fast!
