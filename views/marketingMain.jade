          | The Facebook Rotational Product Manager program trains people excited about technology to become great Product Managers. Facebook RPMs lead three product rotations over twelve months, while receiving guidance from mentors.  At the end of the program, RPMs are equipped to lead cross-functional teams that build high-impact, meaningful products.

      p
        h2 Impact
        | RPMs work on high priority products that impact the lives of the over 1.2 billion people who use Facebook. During each rotation, RPMs have full ownership of a project. They create a product vision, set roadmaps, prioritize goals, and analyze data to measure success.  RPMs collaborate with engineers, designers, and data analysts to build world-class social tools.
        br
        br
        h2 Growth  
        | Learning and development is key to the program. On each project rotation, RPMs work closely with veteran PM mentors to develop the skills needed to become a successful Product Manager and leader at Facebook. RPMs also learn from each other — acting as sounding boards to pitch and test out new ideas.
        br
        br
        h2 Community  
        | RPMs form a tight, cohesive community within Facebook. They come from a variety of backgrounds and industries, which creates unique opportunities for learning and collaboration. In addition to a strong professional community, RPMs also become great friends. They hang out, grab lunch, and some RPMs even live together.

        i PMs at Facebook come from a variety of disciplines, places, and world views. My favorite part of being an RPM is getting to see this diversity in action when people think out loud during brainstorm sessions- there's so much creativity and passion!"

        i Jokes aside, I come from a more traditional computer science background. I grew up and studied in Canada but decided to make the move out to Silicon Valley after a few great internship experiences. As a PM, I've learned how to feel when a team is operating well and working towards a vision that everyone is bought into."

        i One project I've worked on at Facebook that I am incredibly passionate about is internet.org. About 80% of the world's population lives within range of a 2G or 3G connection, and yet well over 4B people remain unconnected to the internet. I've gotten to partner with carriers to find economically sustainable ways to make mobile data more affordable and accessible for the world."

         | RPMs are people who are passionate about developing well-crafted products that add value to people's lives and bring delight to their everyday experiences.

         br
        
         h2 Action  
         | RPMs have strong analytical skills along with the ability to break large, messy problems into discrete pieces. Once the problem has been broken down, they need to prioritize the pieces and deliver on them.
         br
         br
        
         h2 Leadership  
         | RPMs inspire and motivate their team to hit goals and ship impactful products. A Product Manager is like the conductor of an orchestra. While they do not design or build, RPMs carry the vision of a product and communicate that vision across cross-functional teams. They shouldn't be afraid to take risks and move fast!
