          | The Facebook Rotational Product Manager program trains people excited about technology to become great Product Managers. Facebook RPMs lead three product rotations over twelve months, while receiving guidance from mentors.  At the end of the program, RPMs are equipped to lead cross-functional teams that build high-impact, meaningful products.

        | Our mission is to create a tight-knit network of PMs who build products that positively impact the world. The program has three goals:
      
      p
        h2 Impact
        | RPMs work on high priority products that impact the lives of the over 1.2 billion people who use Facebook. During each rotation, RPMs have full ownership of a project. They create a product vision, set roadmaps, prioritize goals, and analyze data to measure success.  RPMs collaborate with engineers, designers, and data analysts to build world-class social tools.
        br
        br
        h2 Growth  
        | Learning and development is key to the program. On each project rotation, RPMs work closely with veteran PM mentors to develop the skills needed to become a successful Product Manager and leader at Facebook. RPMs also learn from each other — acting as sounding boards to pitch and test out new ideas.
        br
        br
        h2 Community  
        | RPMs form a tight, cohesive community within Facebook. They come from a variety of backgrounds and industries, which creates unique opportunities for learning and collaboration. In addition to a strong professional community, RPMs also become great friends. They hang out, grab lunch, and some RPMs even live together.

        | As RPMs, we build products that impact the lives of over 1.2 billion people. We're all passionate about connecting the world around us and improving the way people communicate.  We come from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences- here are just a few RPMs who have done some pretty amazing things:

      p(style="font-size:20px; line-height: 150%;")
        | After college, I decided to venture away from my native Chicago and taught math at a high school in Oakland as part of the Teach for America program. After TFA, I worked on a machine learning project with an agricultural robotics startup in Mountain View. 
      p(style="font-size:20px; line-height: 150%;")
        | PMs at Facebook come from a variety of disciplines, places, and world views. My favorite part of being an RPM is getting to see this diversity in action when people think out loud during brainstorm sessions- there's so much creativity and passion!

      p(style="font-size:20px; line-height: 150%;")
        | Fun fact: the first product review I did with Mark Zuckerberg (on week 7 of being at the company) I had to do in spandex bike shorts because I had lost a bet the day before against an RPM Manager. The review went well though!
      p(style="font-size:20px; line-height: 150%;")
        | Jokes aside, I come from a more traditional computer science background. I grew up and studied in Canada but decided to make the move out to Silicon Valley after a few great internship experiences. For one of my rotations, I got to completely reimagine Facebook Pages on mobile. As a PM, I've learned how to feel when a team is happy, operating well, and working towards a vision that everyone is bought into.

      p(style="font-size:20px; line-height: 150%;")
        | One project I've worked on at Facebook that I am incredibly passionate about is internet.org. About 80% of the world's population lives within range of a 2G or 3G connection, and yet well over 4B people remain unconnected to the internet. I've gotten to partner with carriers to find economically sustainable ways to make mobile data more affordable and accessible for the world.

        | I grew up and studied IT and CS engineering in India. After working locally for 2 years, I decided to get my masters in Software Management at CMU. I then moved back to India and worked as a PM for 2 years at Ibibo where I focused on building mobile gaming and messaging products for the Indian market.   
      p(style="font-size:20px; line-height: 150%;")
        | One of my favorite projects at Facebook so far is Stickers (in FB Messenger). They are a lighthearted and delightful form of self-expression with the potential to fundamentally change the way people communicate.

      p(style="font-size:20px; line-height: 150%;")
        | Fun fact: I didn't know what I wanted to do after college, so I bought a one way ticket to India to become a reporter. I ended up in a Bollywood movie, marched with Tibetan monks, photographed the Nepalese revolution, and worked with a Spanish film crew in Mongolia – but it turns out I'm a really mediocre reporter.

         h2 Action  
         | RPMs have strong analytical skills along with the ability to break large, messy problems into discrete pieces. Once the problem has been broken down, they need to prioritize the pieces and deliver on them.

         br
        
         h2 Leadership  
         | RPMs inspire and motivate their team to hit goals and ship impactful products. A Product Manager is like the conductor of an orchestra. While they do not design or build, RPMs carry the vision of a product and communicate that vision across cross-functional teams. They shouldn't be afraid to take risks and move fast!
